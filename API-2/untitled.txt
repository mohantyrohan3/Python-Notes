Authorization - What you can do
Authentication - Who you are


HTTP Basic Authentication

requests.get("Url",auth=HTTPBasicauth("user","password"))
requests.get("Url",auth=("user","password")) // Directly we can write auth=()

from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

Another auth is HTTPDigestAuth

Oauth - Authorization server supplies access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
